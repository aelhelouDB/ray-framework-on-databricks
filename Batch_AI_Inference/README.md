# Batch AI Inference on Databricks with Ray

## Business Problem
Organizations need to process large volumes of unstructured data (text, images, speech, and video) efficiently at scale. Traditional single-node inference approaches become bottlenecks when dealing with massive datasets. This solution demonstrates how to leverage Ray's distributed computing capabilities on Databricks to perform efficient batch inference across different AI modalities:

- Text and image-to-text processing using Vision models
- Automatic Speech Recognition using Whisper-v3
- Text and video-to-text processing using Qwen2.5 VL

By implementing these patterns, organizations can significantly reduce inference time and process large batches of multimedia data efficiently while maintaining high throughput and resource utilization.
