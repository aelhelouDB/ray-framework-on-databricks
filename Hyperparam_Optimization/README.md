# Hyperparameter Optimization with Ray on Databricks

## Business Problem
Machine learning practitioners face the challenge of finding optimal model configurations across a vast parameter space. Manual tuning is time-consuming and often yields suboptimal results. This solution demonstrates how to leverage Ray's distributed computing capabilities on Databricks to perform efficient, parallel hyperparameter optimization for:

- General machine learning models using Optuna & Ray Tune
- XGBoost models with specialized tuning strategies
- Deep Learning and Computer Vision models

By implementing these patterns, organizations can significantly reduce model training time, improve model performance, and automate the process of finding optimal hyperparameters at scale.
