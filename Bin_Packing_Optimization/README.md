# Bin Packing Optimization

## Business Problem
![Bin packing objective](../images/binpack_objective.png)

The bin packing problem is a classic optimization challenge that has far-reaching implications for enterprise organizations across industries. At its core, the problem focuses on finding the most efficient way to pack a set of objects into a finite number of containers or "bins", with the goal of minimizing wasted space. 

This challenge is pervasive in real-world applications, from optimizing shipping and logistics to efficiently allocating resources in data centers and cloud computing environments. With organizations often dealing with large numbers of items and containers, finding optimal packing solutions can lead to significant cost savings and operational efficiencies. 

This solution demonstrates how to scale a single-threaded Python library with [Ray Core](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html) components.
